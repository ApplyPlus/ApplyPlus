Requirments: Python3.6 and above

To run the scripts run: 
`python3 apply.py [--reverse] [--help] <path_to_patch> `

`path_to_patch` is required and is the path to the patch you are applying

`--help` will list available subcommands and some
concept guides

`--reverse` will run `git apply --reverse`
